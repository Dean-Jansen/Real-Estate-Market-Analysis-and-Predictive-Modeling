## Sample Data
The [real_estate_data.csv](real_estate_data.csv) file contains 50 simulated samples of real estate data, including information on square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, location, amenities, and price.

## Project Components
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
    - Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
    - Merge datasets to combine real estate information with demographic and economic data.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    - Visualize the distribution of property prices.
    - Create interactive visualizations using Power BI.

3. **Predictive Modeling:**
    - Train a linear regression model to predict property prices.
    - Evaluate the model's performance using mean squared error.

4. **Power BI Visualization:**
    - Develop an interactive dashboard showcasing market trends and predictions.
    - Include features like filters, maps, and price calculators.

5. **SQL Database Integration:**
    - Store and manage real estate data in a SQL database.
    - Write SQL queries for efficient data retrieval.
